# Pronunciation-Quiz
A pronunciation listening quiz for ESL students. 

## Project History
This project was a homework assignment for the Columbia Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp, testing our ability to use Timeouts and Intervals in Javascript. The project prompt was to create a trivia game. Rather than another game application, I opted to create something that could help my pronunciation students test their ability to distinguish similar English phonemes from the comfort of their own homes.
