# Pronunciation-Quiz
A pronunciation listening quiz for ESL students. 

## How To Play
[Click here to play the game](https://evansimonross.github.io/Pronunciation-Quiz/).

This is a listening quiz designed to help ESL students learn to distinguish some of the trickier phonemes of English. The player goes through the menu options to choose a group of sounds to practice. Then, a randomly generated set of 10 questions will play in succession. 

For each question, an audio file of one word's pronunciation will play. On the screen, at least two similarly pronounced words will appear. Only one matches the audio that played. If the player chooses correctly, their "Correct" score will increase. And incorrect choice will increase the "Incorrect" score. 

The player only has five seconds to decide which option is correct. After five seconds, the player's "Time Up" score increases, and the game automatically moves on to the next question.

After 10 questions are up or the player has selected "Quit", the player is given a report screen showing their incorrect or timed-out answers. All words on this display can be clicked to replay audio samples. The player can select "Try Again" for 10 more questions from the same set, excluding those already played, or "Main Menu" to try a different set. 

When the "IPA Mode" button is toggled off, the words in the quiz are displayed in their standard English spelling. When it is toggled on, the words are displayed in IPA symbols.

## Project History
This project was a homework assignment for the Columbia Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp, testing our ability to use Timeouts and Intervals in Javascript. The project prompt was to create a trivia game. Rather than another game application, I opted to create something that could help my pronunciation students test their ability to distinguish similar English phonemes from the comfort of their own homes.
